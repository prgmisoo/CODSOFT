Machine Learning Project Tasks Readme [CODSOFT]

Task Explanation

Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Predicting movie Genres is a multilabel classification problem where a movie can be tagged to more than one Genres.For the sake of simplicity, we will be predict whether a movie belongs to a particular Genre or not (one-vs-rest approach) by the end of this project using various data mining and machine learning processes. 
IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
As of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users.
IMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.

Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit card fraud detection using machine learning involves the application of algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities. Features such as transaction amount, location, and frequency are used to train models that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Supervised learning techniques, like logistic regression or neural networks, are commonly employed for this task. 
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn prediction using machine learning involves developing models that can forecast the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services or subscriptions. Various features such as usage patterns, customer satisfaction, and engagement metrics are utilized to train the model. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or advanced methods like neural networks can be employed for this supervised learning task. It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting the information that , this particular customer will leave bank or not.
